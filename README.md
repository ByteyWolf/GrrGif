## About
**GrrGif** is a work-in-progress GIF editor for Win32-based systems. It strives to offer the most features while being slim and mindful of resources.

You can compile it yourself by opening the Open Watcom C project file in the `/build` directory.

## What's Done
- Main GUI
- 2 out of 3 windows (Preview and Timeline)
- (somewhat broken) dragging GIFs around the canvas
- Tracks and timeline
- GIF importing
- Project saving

## To do
- Actually implement GIF exporting
- Edit boxes
- Fix bugs (there's too many)
- Add effects
